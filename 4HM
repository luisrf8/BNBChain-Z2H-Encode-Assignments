1. Add a variable to hold the address of the deployer of the contract
2. Update that variable with the deployer's address when the contract is
deployed.
3. Write an external function to return
1. Address 0x000000000000000000000000000000000000dEaD if called by
the deployer
2. The deployer's address otherwise
